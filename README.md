## Flight Logic 
The flight program is structured as a state machine with the following states: adopted from BPS space 
| State  | Description  | Waiting for event |
|---|---| -----|
| 0  | Pre-Flight Ground    | altitude >= 10m AGL  |
| 1  | Powered Flight      |  velocity < 0  to detect apogee |
| 2  | Apogee   |  10m below apogee to deploy parachute  |
| 3  | Chute Descent| altitude <= 10m AGL|
| 4  | Post-flight Ground    |  No more events  |
